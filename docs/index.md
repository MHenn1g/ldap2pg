## Highlighted features

- Configure multiples LDAP queries.
- Customize Postgres role options (`LOGIN`, `SUPERUSER`, `REPLICATION`, etc.).
- Create, alter and drop roles.
- Manage role members.
- Grant or revoke ACLs per database and/or per schema.
- Dry run to audit a cluster.


## Quick installation

Just use PyPI as any regular Python project:

``` console
# pip install ldap2pg
# ldap2pg --help
```

Now you **must** configure Postgres and LDAP connexions as well as the
synchronization map.
The
[dumb but tested `ldap2pg.yml`](https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/blob/master/ldap2pg.yml) is
a good way to start.

``` console
# curl -LO https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/raw/master/ldap2pg.yml
# editor ldap2pg.yml
```

Finally, it's up to you to use `ldap2pg` in a crontab or a playbook. Have funÂ !
