<h1>Inspecting Postgres cluster</h1>

ldap2pg follows the explicit create / implicit drop and explicit grant /
implicit revoke model. Thus properly inspecting cluster for what you want to
drop/revoke is very crucial to succeed in synchronization.

ldap2pg inspects databases, schemas, roles, owners and grants with SQL queries.
You can customize all these queries in the `postgres` YAML section with
parameters ending with `_query`. See [ldap2pg.yaml reference] for details.

[ldap2pg.yaml reference]: config.md#postgres-parameters


## What databases to synchronizeÂ ?

`databases_query` returns the flat list of databases to manage. When dropping
roles, ldap2pg loops the databases list to reassign objects and clean GRANTs of
to be dropped role. This databases list also narrows the scope of GRANTs
inspection. ldap2pg will revoke GRANTs only on these databases. See
[ldap2pg.yaml reference] for details.

``` yaml
postgres:
  databases_query: |
    SELECT datname
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_database
    WHERE datallowconn IS TRUE;
```


## Synchronize a subset of roles

By default, ldap2pg manages all roles from Postgres, minus the default
blacklist. If you want ldap2pg to synchronsize only a subset of roles, you need
to customize inspection query in `postgres:managed_roles_query`. The following
query excludes superusers from synchronization.

``` yaml
postgres:
  managed_roles_query: |
    SELECT 'public'
    UNION
    SELECT rolname
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles
    WHERE rolsuper IS FALSE
    ORDER BY 1;
```

ldap2pg will only drop, revoke, grant on roles returned by this query. This
*whitelist* also applies to members. Only members matching this list may be
removed from a group. Members not matching this list will be left in the group.

A common case for this query is to return only members of a group like
`ldap_roles`. This case is tested in
[ldap2pg.yml](https://github.com/dalibo/ldap2pg/blob/master/ldap2pg.yml) sample.
This way, ldap2pg is scoped to a subset of roles in the cluster.

The `public` role does not exists in the system catalog. Thus if you want
ldap2pg to manage `public` privileges, you must include explicitly `public` in
the set of managed roles. This is the default. Of course, even if `public` is
managed, ldap2pg won't drop or alter it if it's not in the directory.

A safety net to completely ignore some roles is [roles_blacklist_query].

``` yaml
postgres:
  roles_blacklist_query: [postgres, pg_*]  # This is the default.
```

[roles_blacklist_query]: config.md#postgres-roles-blacklist-query

!!! note

    A pattern starting with a `*` **must** be quoted. Else you'll end up with a
    YAML error like `found undefined alias`.


## Inspecting Schema & Owners

Except with database privileges and global default privileges, almost all
privileges are schema aware. Thus ldap2pg needs to known what schemas are in
each database. This is the purpose of `schemas_query`.

When managing `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` with ldap2pg, you must tell who are
owners. Owners are roles supposed to create or drop objects in database such as
tables, views, functions, etc. ldap2pg checks that every owners have proper
default privileges. This way you dont have to re-run ldap2pg when an owner
creates a new object in the cluster.

There is two ways of listing owners: *globally* or *per schema*. With
[owners_query] you can specify a global list of owners common to all databases
and all schemas. With [schemas_query] you can specify owners *per schema*.

[owners_query]: config.md#postgres-owners-query
[schemas_query]: config.md#postgres-schemas-query


### Per-Schema Owners Example

In this example, each schema is associated with a `owners_%` group whose name
includes schema name.

``` yaml
postgres:
  schemas_query: |
    SELECT
      nspname,
      array_agg(owner.rolname) FILTER (WHERE rolname IS NOT NULL)
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles AS owners_group
      ON owners_group.rolname = 'owners_' || nspname
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_auth_members AS ms ON ms.roleid = owners_group.oid
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles AS owner ON owner.oid = ms.member
    GROUP BY 1
```


## Static Queries

You can replace all queries with a **static list** in YAML. This list will be
used as if returned by Postgres. That's very handy to freeze a value like
databases or schemas.

``` yaml
postgres:
  databases_query: [postgres]
  schemas_query: [public]
```
